						<p>There are 3 things you need to look out for when buying a host</p><br>
                        <p>1: Latency: if hosting a site for local use only, use a host with servers relatively close, if hosting site globally, use a host with servers across the world</p><br>
                        <p>2: Cost: Don't buy a host that is too expensive for your needs, only get what you need. However the inverse works as well, don't underpay for hosting</p><br>
                        <p>3: Service Quality: Don't buy the bottom of the barrel host unless you can work around the limitations that may be provided, such as high downtime</p>

					  <div class="flip-box-back8">
						<h2>These are 5 ways to improve your website on google</h2>
                        <p>1: Use a Robots.txt file: Robots.txt tells google where on your site not to trawl for search results, useful for say, a shopping cart</p><br>
                        <p>2: Use Title tags correctly: Title tags will show up as the pages name on google, so name it well</p><br>
                        <p>3: Use Meta tags correctly: the description tag will be used for the sites description on google</p><br>
                        <p>4: Use Structured data markup: this is more useful for stores, but if you use structured data markup, it will allow google to display prices and reviews for whatever product it is</p><br>
                        <p>5: Keep your URLs simple: keeping your urls simple allows for google to parse it easier</p>

					  </div>
					  <div class="flip-box-back9">
						<h2>Here is 5 common attacks and how to prevent them</h2>
                        <p>1: Man in the middle attack: man in the middle attack is when a malicious actor hijacks the connection between a server and user, generally by being on the same network as the user</p>
                        <p>How to prevent?: Use HTTPS. HTTPS encrypts traffic, preventing this from happening</p>
                        <p>2: Attacks using legacy attack vectors: Currently most famous in New Zealand for the DHB hack, legacy attack vectors rely on software that has not been updated but security flaws have been published for it</p>
                        <p>How to prevent?: Update software when it becomes EOL(End Of Life)</p>
                        <p>3: DDoS: Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS is when a server is overloaded with requests, generally from malicious people, using botfarms</p>
                        <p>How to prevent?: Use a DDoS mitigation service such as Cloudflare</p>
                        <p>4: Breaches in closed source software: Closed source software does not allow 3rd parties to verify security as the code is hidden from the user, this can be used if someone finds a vulnerability</p>
                        <p>How to prevent?: Use open source alternatives to closed source software, as open source allows you to look at the code and verify for yourself, alongside others</p>
                        <p>5:Accidentally leaving ports open: ports allow for programs to communicate over the internet, however some can do more than others, such as port 1433</p>
                        <p>How to prevent?: close all ports except for those that are necessary</p>

                        <p>Loading times</p>
                        <p>1: put javascript at the bottom of the page, to allow for it to load last</p>
                        <p>2: use appropriately sized images, reducing bandwidth used loading it</p>

                        <p>Maintenance</p>
                        <p>1: always try to announce maintenance ahead of time</p>
                        <p>2: use the downtime to update plugins</p>
                        <p>3: check for irregularities in the filesystem, this may unveil an attack that took place</p>
                        <p>4: run backups</p>
                        <p>5: make sure the backup isn't corrupted</p>
